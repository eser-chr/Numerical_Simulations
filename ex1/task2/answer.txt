To justify the use of a log scale, we need to calculate the linear interpolation of the logarithm of the data and calculate the correlation coefficient between this interpolation and the logarithm of the data.
Here the coefficient of determination for the CPU count is approximately R2 = 0.977, so we can conclude that the interpolation of the logarithm is quite pertinent and therefore, using a log-scale is appropriate.
